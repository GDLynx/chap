# This tests various commands against a live core from a simple python program
# that starts 4 extra threads, each of which sleeps an hour.
# In this particular case, the core was gathered against a recent redhat
# distribution for which gdb has a bug that when it creates a core it
# marks any inaccessible sections as read-only, rather than as inaccessible.
# The test expects chap to mostly behave as if those sections are marked
# correctly but to find any such sections that are used as stack guards,
# module alignment regions, or heap tails.

# Warning: the core is rather large here due to the fact that the
# inaccessible regions with the wrong (read-only) permissions actually
# get rather useless but huge 0-filled images in the core.
